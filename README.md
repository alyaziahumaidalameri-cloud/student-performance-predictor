# Student Performance Predictor

This project is an introductory machine learning application that predicts
whether a student is likely to pass based on study time and absences.

## Dataset
- Small student performance dataset
- Features:
  - Study time
  - Number of absences
- Target:
  - Pass / Fail

## Model
- Logistic Regression
- Used for binary classification

## What I learned
- How to work with real datasets
- Basic machine learning workflow
- Train/test split and model evaluation
- Interpreting model accuracy

## Why this project
This project was created to understand the foundations of machine learning
before moving to more advanced AI models.
